# Calibron 12 Puzzle
## Description
I was inspired to create a virtual version of this puzzle—including a solution algorithm—after I received a physical copy as a gift. I used a recursive backtracking search for the auto-solving feature. This puzzle is quite difficult to solve by hand - please have a go if you would like! The puzzle was originally invented by Theodore Edison almost century ago. (Unfortunately this project is not mobile friendly.)
## How to play
The goal is simple - fit all of the smaller pieces into the larger square, without any of them overlapping. Pieces can be moved by clicking and dragging them. Press R while dragging to rotate.
